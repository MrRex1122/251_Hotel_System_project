# Hotel System Project

Console-based hotel management system implemented in C++ to simulate real-world hotel operations such as check-in, check-out, room availability, billing, and customer validation.

## üè® Project Overview

This project is a terminal-driven hotel management program designed for educational purposes. It provides hotel staff with the ability to manage customer data, assign rooms, track billing, and generate logs using text-based files as storage.

## üìÇ File-Based Data Handling

The system uses the following plain text files:
- `rooms.db` ‚Äî stores current room status
- `customers.db` ‚Äî records customer name, ID, dates, and balance
- `bookings.db` ‚Äî keeps an overview of ongoing bookings
- `bills.db` ‚Äî logs all billing transactions

All file I/O operations are handled via standard C++ streams, with checks for file validity and graceful error handling.
